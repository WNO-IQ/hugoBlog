Since i studied in primary school, i tried to build blog website in many severs. However i only immersed myself in the duration of building websites, and i didn't calm down to post some articles on the blog after building each time. Now i am studying at a trash senior high, so i am able to write something in the leisure time. Althoght i am interested in some high-tech products, for instance computers, i just scratch the surface of programming and Computer Science. So this blog is used as a platform for me to share something and practise my English writing skill.
