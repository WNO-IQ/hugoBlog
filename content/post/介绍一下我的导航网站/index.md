Before building this blog, i built a navigation website (for Chinese). The source code of the nav website is based on these two projects on Github [sou2](https://github.com/yeetime/sou2) & [sou](https://github.com/5iux/sou).

The blog and navigation are both deployed on the Vercel, its speed of access is pretty well for free use and it can be directly accessed by Chinese.
